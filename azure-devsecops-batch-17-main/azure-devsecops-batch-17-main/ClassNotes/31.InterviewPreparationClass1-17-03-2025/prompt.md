I want to create a interview story, I joined one class today where I got to know about the below introduction that I can say in my interview. Can you please help me in creating introductions like that with any another functional use case.

I am Aman, I am working in DevOps Insiders from last 10 Years,
and here we are majorly working on a Industrial IOT based
requirement for a US based customer.

So The Requirement is that, Our client have multiple dams at
different locations, He want a portal and a mobile application
where he can get all the deatils of the dam like electricity creation
in units, Total Water in the reservoir.

So, The client have already created a custom industrial IOT
Device that is connected to all the turbines in their dams, and that
device is sending the data continously to azure cloud.

Now, the Client wanted that we should consume that data and
create a web portal which will display the incoming data from the
turbines properly and it should also create alerts if the electricity
creation is not happening properly.

So for this project, We had a developer team and a devops
team .. and the web portal was a 3 tier application which had
frontend, backend and a database. We were having around 5
frontend developers in our team, 4 backend developers in our
team.

I was the part of DevOps Team and our primary job was to create
the deployment architecture of the application and the cicd
pipelines.
