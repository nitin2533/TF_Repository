# Terraform State Locking

**Overview:**
- Terraform state locking is a mechanism to prevent concurrent operations on a Terraform state file.
- This helps to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency when multiple users or processes are working with the same state file.

**Why is it needed?**
- Prevents state corruption that can occur if multiple users or automated processes apply changes simultaneously.
- Ensures that only one operation can modify the state at any given time.

**How does it work?**
- When Terraform performs a state-changing operation (like `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy`), it attempts to acquire a lock.
- If the lock is acquired successfully, the operation proceeds. If not, Terraform waits or fails depending on the configuration.
- After the operation completes, the lock is released.

**Types of backends that support locking:**
- S3 with DynamoDB
- Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud Storage
- HashiCorp Consul

### State Locking with Azure Storage Account

**Overview:**
- Azure Storage Account can be used as a backend for storing Terraform state files.
- Azure Blob Storage supports state locking and consistency checking via Azure Blob Lease mechanism.

**Setup:**
1. **Create a Storage Account:**
   - In the Azure portal, create a new Storage Account.
   - Create a container within the Storage Account to store the state file.

2. **Configure Terraform:**
   - Update the Terraform configuration to use the Azure Storage Account as the backend.
   - Example configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "myResourceGroup"
    storage_account_name  = "myStorageAccount"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

3. **Locking Mechanism:**
   - Azure Blob Storage uses a Blob Lease to manage state locks.
   - When a Terraform operation is initiated, it acquires a lease on the blob. If the lease cannot be acquired, it means another operation is in progress, and the new operation will wait or fail based on the settings.

Certainly! Here are the complete notes on Terraform state locking, state locking with Azure Storage Account, implicit dependency, and explicit dependency, specifically in the context of Azure.
