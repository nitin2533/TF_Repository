### Assignment: Understanding Key Concepts in Technology  

#### **1. Authentication vs. Authorization**  
- Research and define **authentication** and **authorization**, focusing on their roles in system security.  
- Compare their functionalities:  
  - **Authentication:** Verifying identity.  
  - **Authorization:** Granting permissions.  
- Provide examples of how they are used in a web application.  
- Discuss the technologies or tools used for each, such as OAuth, JWT, and RBAC.  

#### **2. Imperative vs. Declarative**  
- Define **imperative programming** and **declarative programming** in your own words.  
- Highlight their differences using real-world examples (e.g., manual vs. automated tasks).  
- Compare their use cases in software development, such as configuration management (Terraform for declarative vs. shell scripts for imperative).  
- Research the pros and cons of each approach.  

#### **3. Difference Between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS**  
- Define **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**, **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**, and **Software as a Service (SaaS)**.  
- Provide examples of services or tools under each category (e.g., Azure VM for IaaS, Azure App Service for PaaS, Microsoft 365 for SaaS).  
- Compare their use cases and benefits in cloud computing.  
- Include a diagram or table to visualize their differences.  

This assignment will help you deepen your understanding of key concepts in technology, preparing you for practical applications.
