# **Assignment: Deploy a Starbucks Clone on Nginx Server**

### **Objective:**  
The purpose of this assignment is to set up an Nginx web server and deploy a Starbucks Clone application using the Killerkoda Ubuntu Playground.

### **Instructions:**  

1. **Access the Killerkoda Ubuntu Playground:**  
   - Open your web browser and go to [Killerkoda Ubuntu Playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu).  

2. **Initialize the Playground:**  
   - Click the "Start" button to set up the Ubuntu environment.  

3. **Update the System:**  
   - Once the playground is ready, update the package list by running the following command:  
     ```sh
     sudo apt update
     ```

4. **Install Nginx:**  
   - Install the Nginx web server with the following command:  
     ```sh
     sudo apt install nginx -y
     ```

5. **Clone the Starbucks Clone Repository:**  
   - Clone the repository containing the Starbucks Clone application files:  
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/devopsinsiders/starbucks-clone.git
     ```

6. **Copy Build Artifacts to Nginx Directory:**  
   - Navigate to the cloned repository:  
     ```sh
     cd starbucks-clone
     ```  
   - Copy all the files from the cloned repository to Nginx's default web root directory:  
     ```sh
     sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
     ```

7. **Check Nginx Status:**  
   - Verify that Nginx is running by checking its status:  
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```

8. **Expose Port 80:**  
   - Use the "Expose" option in the Killerkoda interface to make port 80 accessible externally.  

9. **Access the Starbucks Clone Application:**  
   - After exposing port 80, access the provided URL or click the relevant button to view the Starbucks Clone application in your browser.  

### **Deliverables:**  
- Submit a screenshot showing the deployed Starbucks Clone application in your browser.
